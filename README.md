Udemy RPG - Unity Repo

It appears that this repo is finally up and working! Save all Unity projects and changes here!

Current versions of Unity as of October 5, 2017
Mac: Unity 2017.1.1f1 (Previously Unity 2017.1.0f3 as of 09-01-2017)
Windows: Unity 2017.1.1f1 (Previously Unity 5.6.1f1 as of 09-01-2017)


I installed Unity 2017.1.0f3 from MacBook on October 5. New version to be used on both MacBook and Windows desktop is 2017.1.1f1.

2017.1.0f3 has a bug with MacOS High Sierra 10.13 that causes MonoDevelop to crash upon
opening. Unity 2017.1.1f1 patch 3 or later should correct that issue...

MONODEVELOP CRASH STILL EXISTS!!
